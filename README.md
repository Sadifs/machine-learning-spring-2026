## Course Overview

This repository contains my coursework for **BSAN 6070: Introduction to Machine Learning** at Loyola Marymount University.  
The course provides a hands-on, application-oriented introduction to machine learning, with a focus on:

- Supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms  
- Feature engineering and data preprocessing  
- Model training, evaluation, and optimization  
- Interpreting machine learning models for business decision-making  

All work is completed using **Python** in **Jupyter Notebooks**, following best practices for reproducibility, documentation, and version control.
